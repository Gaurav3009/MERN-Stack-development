React Js:
    React is a javascript library used to create single page frontend application.
    React is fast beacuse it uses virtual DOM.
    also we can make reusable components in React.
    Data flow is uni-directional from parent to child.
    It uses JSX to write code simpler.

Angular is a framework and javascript is a library.
Framework gives us full power to deploy the app but library doesn't have that power.

Single Page Application : React we don't have referesh and we can direct route and change the content. 
It means we can change the contents on the same page using some conditions.
This is why it is fast.

Component : It is teh independent piece of code which we can implemennt anywhere.
There are two types of components.
1> Functional Components 
2> Class Based Components


Virtual DOM : It is the programming technique where a virtual copy of DOM is kept. 
In DOM if a chnage happens in particular place whole page is rendered again.
Virtual DOM is the virtual copy of the actual DOM in the memory and if any change made to it creates  another 
virtual DOM with the changes and then compares using BFS and when changes found then the cahnges is applied
and then the previous DOM is deleted.

JSX: It is teh way of writing HTML inside javascript.

npm : is a package where we can access the codes pre written
